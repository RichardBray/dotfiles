## Audio Hook Configuration

### Issue Resolution (2025-07-07)
The stop.py audio hook was not working due to incorrect audio file path configuration.

**Problem:** 
- stop.py was looking for audio files at `/Users/richardoliverbray/.claude/hooks/audio/`
- Actual audio files are located at `/Users/richardoliverbray/.claude/audio/`

**Solution:**
- Changed line 26 in `/Users/richardoliverbray/.claude/hooks/stop.py` from:
  ```python
  audio_dir = Path(__file__).parent / "audio"
  ```
- To:
  ```python
  audio_dir = Path(__file__).parent.parent / "audio"
  ```

**Audio Files Available:**
- task_complete.mp3
- build_complete.mp3  
- tests_passed.mp3
- deployment_complete.mp3
- error_fixed.mp3
- ready.mp3

**Hook Configuration:**
- Stop hook is configured in settings.json to run `uv run .claude/hooks/stop.py`
- Hook plays task_complete.mp3 by default or accepts argument for specific sound

### Status (2025-07-07)
âœ… **RESOLVED** - Audio hook is now working correctly after fixing the file path configuration.
